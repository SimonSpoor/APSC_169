                <b>What I did</b><br>
                As the lead designer in our project, I was responsible for overseeing the design of our product. I
                worked with my team to develop a novel subsurface irrigation system intended for use in industrial
                farming. I was selected for my role because of my previous experience working with 3d modelling software
                and my interest in fluid dynamics.
                <br><br>
                <b>Why I did it</b><br>
                Agriculture uses 70% of the world's freshwater, and much of that is wasted through evaporation caused by
                inefficient irrigation practices. Subsurface irrigation is much more efficient than the surface
                irrigation systems common in corn agriculture but they are difficult to implement and maintain on such a
                large scale. Our group aimed to create a sturdier product that could withstand the weight of heavy farm
                equipment.

                <b>How I did it</b><br>
                After several ideation sessions and an analysis with a weighted evaluation matrix, our group decided
                that we would create a novel subsurface irrigation system made out of concrete with small slits between
                hollow blocks to facilitate water flow. I developed a mathematical model to simulate our solution using
                the principles of fluid and soil dynamics. This approach allowed our team to quickly test different
                variables such as pipe radius and block length. Once we were satisfied with the results, I modeled a
                prototype for printing. During our cost benefit analysis it became clear that our initial design would
                be too resource intensive to be feasable, so a second design session was held where we streamlined the
                design in order to be both cost effective and efficient at reducing water waste.

                <b>Reflection</b><br>
                Over the course of this project I learned a lot about adapting project expectations due to new
                information or changing circumstances. For example, our group initially planned to tackle Ecoli
                contamination in Kelowna's Rotary Park believing that this may have been due to stormwater runoff,
                however following a thorough examination of the data we discovered that our hypothesis was false.
                Thankfully we were early enough in the project's life cycle to pivot to a different focus. Over the
                semester we frequently discovered new information that contradicted our previous assumptions and had to
                adjust the course of our project. This was most noticable in my own work while I worked on the
                mathematical model of our system. Without having taken a formal fluid or soil dynamics course beforehand
                I relied on study materials found online to learn these subjects in a self-directed environment. This
                was difficult, but necessary for our group's success. I frequently had to review and adjust my
                calculations after coming accross new information that caused me to doubt my previous models. Throughout
                this process I not only gained technical skills in modeling and data analysis, but also developed a
                deeper understanding of problem solving and teamwork. Adapting to the challenges we faced taught me to
                be open to change and to never give up in the face of adversity; values I hope to carry forward into my
                engineering career.
