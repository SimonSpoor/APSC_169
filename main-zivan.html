                Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater usage, with corn being one of the most water intensive
                crops. Seeing the environmental and economic challenges brought up by current irrigation systems, our
                team embarked on a mission to design a sustainable and innovative irrigation system for Canadian corn
                farming. As the Scientific Design Lead, I played a significant role in developing and testing solutions
                that minimize water usage while maintaining crop yield and quality. The project aimed to address water
                conservation, reduce environmental impact, and ensure economic feasibility, all within a $100 budget
                constraint. This project was especially important given Canadaâ€™s increasing focus on sustainable farming
                methods.
                <br><br>
                To achieve these objectives, our team followed a pattern of brainstorming ideas, creating prototypes,
                and testing them. We began with brainstorming and stop and engage ideation techniques, generating over
                20 potential solutions. Using a weighted evaluation matrix, we assessed these ideas based on metrics
                such as cost, water efficiency, and durability, ultimately selecting two promising designs: the Water
                Train and Concrete Half-Pipe Systems. The Water Train is an autonomous and modular system that delivers
                water directly to the base of the plant, reducing waste and labor requirements. The Concrete Half-Pipe,
                on the other hand, channels water efficiently while withstanding heavy farm equipment. Both designs were
                thoroughly tested using simulations and physical prototypes to ensure they would work well in real world
                conditions. After testing and prototyping, ultimately the concrete half pipe was chosen as the final
                solution due to its low maintenance cost, water saving and durability.

                This project opened an opportunity for both engineering and personal growth. As the lead for the
                scientific design, I created testing procedures, evaluated the riskiest assumptions and aided in other
                aspects of the project such as the ideation and prototyping of the systems helping me gain hands-on
                experience with prototyping tools and simulation software, enhancing my technical skills. Working
                closely with my teammates, I learned to balance the technological side of the project with user focused
                design, making sure the solutions were practical for Canadian farmers. Beyond the technical aspects, I
                gained a deeper understanding of the environmental impact of agricultural practices, which emphasized
                the critical role of sustainability in engineering.<br><br>

                The impact of this project goes beyond the technical solutions alone. By combining engineering with
                broader perspectives, we created a project that promotes freshwater conservation, supports local
                ecosystems, and strengthens food security. Looking back on this experience, I feel great achievement and
                personal growth as this project made me realise my passion for this course and solving engineering
                problems with a team.
