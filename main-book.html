                <b>What I Did and Why I Did It</b><br><br>
                In our engineering project, I contributed significantly to various aspects across Labs 1–5, each
                building on the overarching goal of designing an efficient and sustainable irrigation system for
                Canadian corn farming by creating a concrete half-pipe for our solution. My involvement ranged from
                foundational analysis to hands-on prototyping, decision-making, and critical assessments. My roles were
                selected based on their alignment with my skills in manufacturing processes, problem-solving, and
                adaptability to dynamic challenges.
                <br><br>
                <b>How I Achieved It</b><br><br>
                Lab 1: I focused on defining the project's Functions, Objectives, and Constraints (FOC). This step was
                crucial for establishing clear, measurable parameters to guide the design process​.<br>
                Lab 2: I created the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Lab 1 and contributed to stakeholder analysis,
                including a stakeholder landscape with detailed categorizations and rationales. This systematic approach
                ensured comprehensive planning and alignment with stakeholder needs.<br>
                Lab 3: I evaluated the quality and creativity of novel solutions like the Improved Rolling Sprinklers
                and Concrete Half-Pipes. This ideation phase involved shortlisting practical solutions and refining our
                design criteria based on creativity and feasibility​.<br>
                Lab 4: I managed the entire manufacturing process, from prototyping the Concrete Half-Pipe system to
                dealing with team dynamics and meeting tight deadlines under pressure. Additionally, I worked to
                mitigate unexpected challenges such as resource limitations and design flaws​.<br>
                Lab 5: I led the Risk Assessment process, where I identified risks across design, management, and
                sustainability categories. Using a color-coded matrix, I prioritized and proposed mitigation strategies
                for high-impact risks

                <b>Learning and Skills Gained</b><br><br>
                Through this process, I honed several key skills:<br>
                Technical Expertise: Improved my ability to assess design feasibility and cost-benefit analysis,
                particularly for manufacturing processes like prototyping and resource allocation.<br>
                Team Collaboration: Enhanced my communication and problem-solving abilities by effectively managing team
                dynamics and coordinating tasks under pressure.<br>
                Project Management: Developed structured frameworks such as the WBS, stakeholder analyses, and risk
                matrices, ensuring that every aspect of the project adhered to both technical and stakeholder
                requirements.

                <b>Reflection</b><br><br>
                This project challenged me to balance creativity with practicality, especially under constraints like
                budget and environmental impact. One critical takeaway was learning how to adapt to evolving
                circumstances—whether addressing unexpected delays or resolving design inefficiencies during
                prototyping. Moreover, working on the risk assessment deepened my understanding of anticipating
                challenges and strategizing effective solutions.<br><br>
                <b>Outcome</b><br><br>
                By integrating technical expertise with structured planning and teamwork, our project successfully
                addressed water conservation in corn farming, offering an innovative solution that holds promise for
                sustainable agriculture.
