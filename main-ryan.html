                Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater usage, with corn being one of the most water intensive
                crops. Seeing the environmental and economic challenges brought up by current irrigation systems, our
                team embarked on a mission to design a sustainable and innovative irrigation system for Canadian corn
                farming. As the Scientific Design Lead, I played a significant role in developing and testing solutions
                that minimize water usage while maintaining crop yield and quality. The project aimed to address water
                conservation, reduce environmental impact, and ensure economic feasibility, all within a $100 budget
                constraint. This project was especially important given Canadaâ€™s increasing focus on sustainable farming
                methods.

                To achieve these objectives, our team followed a pattern of brainstorming ideas, creating prototypes,
                and testing them. We began with brainstorming and stop and engage ideation techniques, generating over
                20 potential solutions. Using a weighted evaluation matrix, we assessed these ideas based on metrics
                such as cost, water efficiency, and durability, ultimately selecting two promising designs: the Water
                Train and Concrete Half-Pipe Systems. The Water Train is an autonomous and modular system that delivers
                water directly to the base of the plant, reducing waste and labor requirements. The Concrete Half-Pipe,
                on the other hand, channels water efficiently while withstanding heavy farm equipment. Both designs were
                thoroughly tested using simulations and physical prototypes to ensure they would work well in real world
                conditions. After testing and prototyping, ultimately the concrete half pipe was chosen as the final
                solution due to its low maintenance cost, water saving and durability.

                For this project, I acted as somewhat of a project management leader. My role was mostly to assign people to 
                each task, fill in whatever needs to be done, and check in and encourage my team to do their best. As I tend to
                have a natural leading personality and cheerful attitude, I grew into the role without having to force anyone to.
                I always was availible to work on whatever was left over or if anyone needed help with anything, organized meetings,
                set reasonable deadlines and checked in with team members in order to help them finish on time, communicating often on the team Discord server. Additionally, I would
                stay up late nights in order to format and create the final report, checking over the rubric to ensure my team gets
                the best mark possible. I acted as a report formatter and organizer and submitted every report in this lab. During the
                Final Video, I acted as filmographer and editor due to my technical skill with my camera, taking photography courses in 
                high school and being interested and playing around with video editing since a child.<br><br>
                
                I feel that I have matured a lot as a leader during this project, with this being one of the first real experiences in which
                I was able to lead a group of people towards a common goal. I give many thanks to my teammates due to how they made me feel
                appreciated and needed every time I did my work, and I did my best to reciprocate that feeling. I have grown a lot as a person
                through this project, from being scared to talk to anyone to being able to easily lead them towards success. For this, I am
                very much grateful for this experience.
